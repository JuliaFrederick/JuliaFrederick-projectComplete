This folder includes all R scripts need for the replication of this manuscript. These files are sourced in the Project_Template.Rmd file in the manuscript folder for this project and do not need to be run prior to running the manuscript markdown file.

There is a `processing_code` folder which includes one .R file that cleans the data.  
There is a `analysis_code` folder that includes 4 files (numbered 1-4), that perform each analysis. If you want to run each piece of code separately from the markdown file fun the analysis codes in number order after running the processing code.
