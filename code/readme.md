##R code Update November 25, 2019
This folder includes all R scripts need for the replication of this manuscript. These files are sourced in the Project_Template.Rmd file in the manuscript folder for this project.

Place your various R or Rmd scripts in the appropriate folders.

You can either have fewer large scripts, or multiple scripts that do only specific actions. Those can be R scripts or Rmd files. In either case, document the scripts and what goes on in them so well that someone else (including future you) can easily figure out what is happening.

The scripts should load the appropriate data (e.g. raw or processed), perform actions, and save results (e.g. processed data, figures, computed values) in the appropriate folders. Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed. 

If scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this. Either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this. Ideally of course in both locations.


Depending on your specific project, you might want to have further sub-folders.
