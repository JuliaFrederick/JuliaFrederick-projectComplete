## November 13, 2019 Update
This folder contains the main file needed to reproduce this project. Running the `/manuscript/Project_Template.Rmd` is the only file needed to produce the final word document. Kitting this file will pull from other .R scripts located in the `code` folder in this project.


The `manuscript` folder contains the template script that is used to reproduce the complete manuscript. There is also a template script that reproduce the supplementary materials that are referenced in the main manuscript.

There is also a `references.bib` file that is used to populate the rerferences used in this project.
